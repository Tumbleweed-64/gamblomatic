# gamblomatic
A playing-card system that can be used to create various games like poker.

## What is this?

_GAMBLOMATIC_ is a C++ playing card system that could theoretically be used to make many classic card games such as 7-card stud or Acey-Deucy.
  
## Upcoming features

I have yet to create most of the example projects, as the system is still in version one. However, what it can do right now is dynamically create a deck, which may be slightly inefficient but allows for more customization. It can also print the deck out, as well as shuffle it. **New feature:** Now there are functions to deal a card and split the deck. This project was originally started in C, but now I've made it better so it uses objects and classes instead of ancient relics like `typedef structs`.

## Other stuff

With v1.04 released, I think that I'm ready to start implementing some functionality for a basic card game, one where you play against the house, like Blackjack or maybe Acey-Deucy. I just need to add a function to deal cards quick, and then I can start. Additionally, I'm reading some papers on game theory optimal poker in order to make some solid bots to play against in the poker examples.

## Example projects provided

- Blackjack (vs not the greatest dealer AI but you can write your own with the help of the library)
- War (not quite finished with this one yet)
- *more coming soon*
