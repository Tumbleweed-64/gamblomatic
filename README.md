# gamblomatic
A playing-card system that can be used to create various games like poker.

_GAMBLOMATIC_ is a C++ playing card system that could theoretically be used to make many classic card games such as 7-card stud or Acey-Deucy.
  
## Upcoming features

I have yet to create most of these examples, as the system is still in version one. However, what it can do right now is dynamically create a deck, which may be slightly inefficient but allows for more customization. It can also print the deck, and I just very recently added shuffling. This project was originally started in C, so please excuse the un-C++-like programming practices. 

## Other stuff

Once I get more functions written I'll definitely turn `deck` into a class as opposed to a simple typedef. Additionally, I'm reading some papers on game theory optimal poker in order to make some solid bots to play against in the poker examples.
